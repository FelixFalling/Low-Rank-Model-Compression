## MY REPORT
So this homework was pretty straight forward, at least for the part that I did which was Exercise #1: Low-Rank Model Compression. 
The only part that was a bit hard was translating the the math that was given into code, but since
we gone over like how to do SVD in the homework actually implementing it for shrinking a model was not too hard.
The instructions given in the assignment were detailed enough so that following them wasn't so hard actually, they were very detailed 
so know what to do wasn't really an issue for me and I didn't run into any roadblocks.

I did try to run this on jupiter notebook on the ORCA super computer that we have at PSU but I wasn't able to figure out how 
to do that unfortunately.

I also found out that you can print css values as colors in the terminal, this happen when I was trying to print out the Epoch #.
